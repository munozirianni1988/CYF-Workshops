# Node workshop

In this workshop, we'll build up a NodeJS app from the ground up and check our understanding as we go along.

Remember to preview the `README` first.

## Level 600

Welcome to Node Workshop Level 600.

In this level, we've moved the albums data to another file `albums.js` to keep `app.js` tidier.

Read the source code in `app.js` and then predict what will happen when you call the endpoint `localhost:9090/albums`

What problem do you notice? Why is this happening?

{YOUR ANSWER HERE}
It threw an error because the albums array wasn't imported into the app.js, therefore it wasn't defined.

How can you fix this problem? Fix it, check it works and then commit 💪
We need to export the albums array to the app.js
