# Node workshop

In this workshop, we'll build up a NodeJS app from the ground up and check our understanding as we go along.

Remember to preview the `README` first.

## Level 600

Welcome to Node Workshop Level 600.

In this level, we've moved the albums data to another file `albums.js` to keep `app.js` tidier.

Read the source code in `app.js` and then predict what will happen when you call the endpoint `localhost:9090/albums`

What problem do you notice? Why is this happening?

{YOUR ANSWER HERE}
It threw an error because the albums array wasn't imported into the app.js, therefore it wasn't defined.

How can you fix this problem? Fix it, check it works and then commit ðŸ’ª
We need to export the albums array to the app.js
